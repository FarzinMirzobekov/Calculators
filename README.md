# Calculators
When I tried to relearn the javaFX, because I was nit good at it, I found a code on github for calculator. I saved it, and planned to learn using that code. But i forgot about it.
During the exam, I saw that code again and tried to use it as template. However I did not have enough knowledge. Thus here is what we got.
P.S I do not know how to corrextly upload files to github, so there might be errors.
